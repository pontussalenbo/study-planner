# Todos For Study Planner UI

Here things that need to be done for the study planner UI are listed. This is a living document and will be updated as the project progresses.
Please add todos to the list if you think something is missing.
Problematic todos are marked with a `?` and should be discussed before being implemented.

The areas and subtasks are not listed in any particular order of priority. Some of them are more important than others, but they are all importan. Some problems are mutually exclusive, thus can be worked on in parallell whereas some tasks are progessively fullfilled and can not simply be removed once _"completed"_.

## Functionality

- [ ] Select Programme and Class at the very top.
- [ ] Filter by  | Class/Year  | By master (optional) | [get courses]
- [ ] Navbar fixed at top with scroll click and GH + BMCs links

## Design

- [ ] Make tables look less stretched out (grid issue)
- [x] Search field looks a bit compressed(?)
- [ ] Align items flex end for bar charts
- [ ] Color row green when a master is fulfilled

## Others

- [x] Make context dispatch more efficient (useReducer?)
- [ ] Fix Todos with real filters
